## Goals of Pizza project:

Create a website for a pizza company where a user can choose one or more individual toppings (cheese, pepperoni, artichoke, anchovy, etc) and a size to order a pizza and see the final cost.

* Allow the user to choose toppings and size for the pizza they'd like to order.
* Create a pizza object constructor with properties for toppings and size.
* Create a prototype method for the cost of a pizza depending on the selections chosen. Use your own formula for this.

## Methodology

### _The following specs are included in the program:_

* Take input from the user to determine pizza size, toppings, and extras
  input: large, pepperoni, cajun, ranch
  output: Large cajun pizza with pepperoni and a side of ranch

* Store pizza properties when input.
  input: pizza A
  output: Large pizza with pepperoni, cajun, ranch.

* Keep track of pizza in an order total when added.
  input: add pizza A, add pizza B.
  output: Your order is 1 large pizza A and 1 small pizza B

* Add up total order based on pizza sizes and toppings.
  input: Large pepperoni, banana pepper pizza.
  output: Large pizza ($10) + 2 toppings ($0.50 * 2). Your total is: $11.00
